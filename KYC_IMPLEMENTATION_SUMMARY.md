## Admin Responsibilities

### 1. Review KYC Submissions
- Check document clarity
- Verify information accuracy
- Ensure names match across documents
- Confirm address proof is recent (within 3 months)
- Validate selfie matches ID photo

### 2. Make Decision
**Approve:**
- Select which currency to activate (CFA or NGN)
- System auto-activates selected + USDT
- User gets instant access

**Reject:**
- Provide clear rejection reason
- User must resubmit corrected documents
- Common reasons:
  - Document not clear/readable
  - Name mismatch
  - Address proof outdated
  - Selfie doesn't match ID
  - Invalid/expired document

### 3. Monitor Activity
- Track pending submissions
- Review approval metrics
- Monitor fraud indicators
- Generate compliance reports

## Automatic Activation Logic

### Based on User Country

**Nigerian Users:**
```
Country contains "Nigeria" or "NG"
→ Activates: NGN + USDT
→ Remains Frozen: CFA
```

**Other West African Users:**
```
Country is Benin, Togo, Ivory Coast, etc.
→ Activates: CFA + USDT
→ Remains Frozen: NGN
```

**USDT Always Activates:**
```
When either CFA or NGN activates
→ USDT automatically activates
→ Enables crypto transactions
```
