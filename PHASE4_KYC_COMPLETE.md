# Phase 4: KYC Workflow Implementation - Complete ✅

## Summary

The comprehensive KYC (Know Your Customer) verification workflow has been successfully implemented in the KwikX mobile app. Users must now complete KYC verification before accessing wallet features, ensuring regulatory compliance and secure operations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes ✅

- Modified `handle_new_user()` trigger to create wallets with `status: 'frozen'`
- New users get 3 frozen wallets: CFA, NGN, USDT
- Wallets remain inaccessible until KYC approval

- Created `activate_user_wallets()` function for activation logic
- Created `handle_kyc_approval()` trigger for automatic activation
- Auto-activation rules:
  - Nigerian users → NGN + USDT activated
  - Other West African users → CFA + USDT activated
  - USDT always activates when CFA or NGN activates

**Storage Configuration**
- Created `kyc-documents` private bucket in Supabase Storage
